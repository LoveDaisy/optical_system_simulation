This is a toy simulation for an optical system. It is written in MATLAB.
In order to run the test scripts, you need to add this folder to MATLAB's path.

## Features

* All spherical/conical surfaces system.
* All 3rd order aberration.
* All aberration plots (ray fan plot, spot plot, etc.) based on real ray tracing.
* Optimization ability.
* OOP programing style.
